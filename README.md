 welcome to my github, I am a developer, I have examples of several projects that I made, for self-development focus on problem solving, while my project examples vary, ranging from sales applications, cashier applications, financial applications, to see examples of code programs you can seen below, I also receive some input using other people's code and want to collaborate, learn knowledge together.
